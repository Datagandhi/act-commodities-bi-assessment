sql_component:
  title: "SQL Development"
  file_reference: "(`project_documents/sql_assignment.sql`)"
  environment:
    platform: "MS SQL Server (T-SQL syntax)"
    testing_url: "https://sqliteonline.com/ (MS SQL mode)"
  data_model:
    description: "The dataset represents **commodities trading operations** with three main entities:"
    entities:
      - "**Trades**: Individual buy/sell transactions (T001-T010) linked to matched deals via `MatchId`"
      - "**Deals**: Matched trade pairs (M1-M5) with execution dates and assigned traders"
      - "**Traders**: Trader profiles with performance targets (AB=40, RA=20, CM=20)"
  schema_notes:
    - "**Known typo**: `Deals.MatchedData` should be `MatchedDate` (column name inconsistency)"
    - "Dates stored as `date` type with `YYYYMMDD` format (20230401, not 20250401)"
    - "`TraderTarget` is `nvarchar(100)` but contains numeric values - requires casting in calculations"
  required_queries:
    count: 7
    list:
      - "Total sold volume"
      - "Weighted average buy price"
      - "Profit per deal"
      - "Traders who reached targets"
      - "Second-highest profit trader"
      - "Daily profit for April 1-10"
      - "Cumulative profit for April 1-10"
  business_logic:
    - "Trades are **paired by MatchId**: one Buy + one Sell = one Deal"
    - "Profit calculation: `(Sell_Price - Buy_Price) * Volume` per deal"
    - "Weighted average buy price: `SUM(Price * Volume) / SUM(Volume)` for buy-side trades only"
    - "Target achievement: Trader's cumulative profit ≥ TraderTarget"
  sql_patterns:
    - "Use explicit column lists in SELECT (avoid `SELECT *`)"
    - "Join pattern: `Trades → Deals → Traders` via MatchId and TraderCode"

dimensional_model_component:
  title: "Dimensional Modeling Exercise"
  requirements:
    - "Design **SCD Type 2** dimensions"
    - "Create **periodical snapshot fact** tables"
    - "Output: Database diagram showing tables, attributes, PKs, FKs, relationships"
    - "Source: \"Trading Dataset.xlsx\" (separate from SQL assignment data)"
  conventions:
    - "Surrogate keys for dimension tables (e.g., `TraderKey`, not `TraderCode` as PK)"
    - "Natural keys preserved as business keys"
    - "Snapshot fact grain: Daily trader performance metrics"
    - "Expected dimensions: DimTrader (SCD2), DimProduct/Commodity (SCD2) and DimDate"
    - "Expected facts: FactTraderPerformance (periodic snapshots)"

powerbi_component:
  title: "Power BI Report"
  report_name: "(`Performance Overview`)"
  theme:
    file: "`project_documents/act_power_bi_theme.json`"
  data_source:
    file: "\"Trading Dataset.xlsx\""
    note: "(NOT the SQL assignment sample data)"
    transformation: "May require data transformation in Power Query to align with dimensional model"
